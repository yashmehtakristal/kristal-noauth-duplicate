The Advanced version of the application has the same features as the basic, with the addition of the following:

1. Select which LLM model to use
2. Select the number of nodes to retrieve from LLM (during vector search)
3. Select the temperature parameter of LLM
4. Select the request timeout (in seconds) of LLM
5. Select the maximum retries of LLM
6. Select the amount of time for LLM to wait before executing next prompt (in loop)
7. Select whether to display all chunks retrieved from vector search (If no, i.e. default value, will display the chunk that has highest score)
